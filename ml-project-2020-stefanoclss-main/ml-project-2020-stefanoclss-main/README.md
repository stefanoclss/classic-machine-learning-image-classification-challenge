Thanks for cleaning up your code and to structure your report.

Data exploration?

Very good that you finetuned the region detection.

Great that you do model analysis, you are one of the few to do it somewhat correctly (I’m not saying it’s perfect, but more than good enough for now, well done). I suggest you try to explain/reason a bit more about your analysis to improve even more.

You say you will focus more on mathematical properties (which are certainly welcomed, nothing wrong with this), but I wouldn’t dismiss other possibilities from sklearn that easily. There is a lot of preprocessing out there as well, or other stuff you could try. Just saying, so you are not stuck. Also, besides sklearn, there are other libraries/things to be found on the internet as well.

Where is your train/test/validation split strategy? Hyperparameter optimization strategy? Your model tuning strategy lacks some information/features, that’s why it’s yellow. Only logistic regression?

**General Feedback**

Excellent work. You are clearly on the right track to complete a good project. You have some original findings and results. Of course, as you probably know yourself, more work needs to be done towards the final report and new things to be tried.
